GitHub Repository for Certifications and Resume
As a Full Stack Software Developer, I've created a dedicated GitHub repository to showcase my certifications and professional resume. This repository serves as a centralized, accessible platform where potential employers and collaborators can view my qualifications and experience. It includes:

Certifications: Organized folders containing digital copies of my certifications, covering various technologies and skills.
Resume: An up-to-date resume outlining my professional experience, technical skills, and educational background.
This approach not only demonstrates my commitment to transparency and professional development but also leverages GitHub's version control to keep my documents current and accessible.
